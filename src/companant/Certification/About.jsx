          My journey in software development started with a curiosity to create meaningful and efficient solutions to 
          real-world problems. I have experience working with frontend technologies like ReactJS, HTML, CSS, and backend 
          technologies such as Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. With a strong foundation in programming and problem-solving,
          I aim to deliver high-quality and user-friendly applications. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new
